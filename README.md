# ms-access-vba-utilities
Generally helpful VBA modules and classes 

This repo is not indended to manage MS Access projects directly.
Use the File Import option in the VBA Editor tool to import files from the repo to the MS Access project
and use the Export option to save new versions of the module or class. 

Modules are saved as .bas type files
Classes are saved as .cls type files

They can be opened and viewed as text files in Atom or another text editor, but it's better to work with them in the VBA editor
